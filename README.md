# About Game
You are Bill and Phil, two fishermen out on a commerical fishing boat in the middle of the night. However, Bill starts noticing strange things in the waves - things that aren't supposed to be there. <br>
There is only one light, one try, one minute...that can put these anomalies at bay. <br>
Move mouse to move the light. Anomaly will freeze when in contact with the light before dissipating into the waters, harmless once again.
